    "text": "For my master’s thesis, I am working on designing an omnidirectional antenna for data transmission from implanted sensors. Specifically, my design is focused around compatibility with the Urodynamics Monitor / Uromonitor designed by Dr. Majerus. The antenna shown above is made with copper wire on a polyimide board, which is flexible. This allows the board to be rolled into a cylinder so that, as a magnetic field is generated with alternating current flowing through the copper traces, the magnetic field is concentrated along one axis. The above design, not including the straight wires, is about 10mm by 15 mm in area, so it has a diameter of about 5 mm when rolled.\nThe goals of my thesis are to improve upon this design, making an antenna that is less directional without compromising the range of the original design. It is important for transmitting antennas in implanted sensors to be omnidirectional, or to have minimal directionality, because a device like the Urodynamics Monitor can shift after implantation. If a directional antenna were used in this application, it would be difficult to tell where on the body a patient should place a receiving antenna.\nSo far, I have developed a few iterations of this design, but I am still gathering the final results I need to complete my thesis and to write publications on this work. My plan is to collect this remaining data by mid-January and be ready to defend my thesis by late March. I will provide links to my thesis and any publications I write on this work once they are published."

    "text": "LinkedIn\n  \n  \n    \n     Email\n  \n\n\n\n\nWelcome to my website!\nI’m Ben Kwiatkowski, a master’s student at Case Western Reserve University studying electrical engineering. For my master’s, I’m working in the SensRx Lab, led by Dr. Steve Majerus, with the goal of designing specialized antennas for use in an implanted bladder pressure sensor. You can read more about my work in the Projects section of this website.\nMy research interests include wireless communication and power transfer for implanted devices, as well as antenna physics. I am also interested in integrated circuit (IC) design and have contributed to a tape-out for a test chip in Dr. Majerus’ lab.\nMy goals for the future are to get accepted into a PhD program where I can continue similar work with wireless communication between implanted sensors and to get experience designing custom ICs. I’m especially interested in designing radio frequency (RF) ICs for the purposes of RF data transmission and wireless power harvesting. Eventually, whether it be while I’m working on a PhD or beyond, I would like to design an implantable sensor, such as an iteration of Dr. Majerus’ bladder pressure sensor, using custom antennas and ICs that can be tested in animals or even people.\nPlease feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss potential projects, know of any resources related to these topics that you would recommend, or have any questions. Thanks."
